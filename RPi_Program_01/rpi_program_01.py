# Name:         Chris Perry, Sharantz Green, Lucas Alvarado, Cory Strickland
# Date:         10/5/22
# Description:  A text-based game that puts a user in a mansion with 4 rooms.
############################################################################
#                   - There exists a puzzle.
#                       - A door requires a phrase to be deciphered
#                       - The phrase is changeable and randomly encrypted.
#                       - On successful entry of the deciphered phrase,
#                           the user goes outside the house and wins
#                       - When the user wins the game a trophy displays
#                   - There exists a couple of hints around the house.
#                       - There is a book of ciphers that lists a few
#                           cipher methods as chapters.
#                       - There is a six-pack that has an encrypted brand.
#                           - Decrypted, this brand is "Mueller's"
#                               - This is a reference to the German surname
#                                   "Mueller" being connected to the surname
#                                   "Miller".
#                   - There exists an exit through a window that ends the game.
#                           -Before you meet your demise,prove your worth
#                           -there is a battle room that allow you to "fight" the cpu
#                           - When they loose the game, a skull displays.
